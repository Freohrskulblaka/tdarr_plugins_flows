# Tdarr Plugins & Flow Components

## Overview

The Tdarr Plugins & Flow Components repository provides a collection of plugins and components created by me. 
These are made available to the community for anyone interested in following a similar process to optimize their media library. 
I have consolidated various plugins and optimized them to achieve the desired structure for media files.

## Usage

To use the plugins and components, simply copy them into the appropriate server folder and configure inside of Tdarr.
